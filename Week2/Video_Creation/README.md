### Image & Video Creation Instructions

The image files were generated via **Nano Banana / Google Flow Veo** using the following generic cinematic video prompt:

> **Generic Video Prompt**
> Create a cinematic, professional showcase video using the provided still images from the Social Eagle Academy Gen AI Architect offline session at IIT Madras Research Park.
>
> Begin with the title card on a black background, fading in smoothly. Add a very subtle push-in camera movement to give depth to the static text.
>
> Transition gently into wide group shots of students and mentors entering the conference hall with confident body language. Apply slow cinematic push-in and slight parallax motion to bring realism and life to the images.
>
> As the video progresses, show classroom collaboration scenes with students seated around tables using laptops, smiling and engaged. Use minimal camera pans and controlled zooms to highlight teamwork, learning, and achievement.
>
> Maintain consistent natural indoor lighting, realistic colors, and subtle film grain throughout the video for a professional academic documentary feel.
>
> All transitions should be smooth cross-dissolves or soft fades, with no fast cuts or flashy effects.
>
> The emotional tone should feel confident, inspiring, and celebratory — reflecting growth, collaboration, and successful learning.
>
> Conclude the video with the closing message card, holding the frame calmly for a few seconds before fading to black, leaving a sense of accomplishment and continuity.
