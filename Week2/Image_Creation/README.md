# 🖼️ Image Creation using JSON Prompting (Week 2)

## Program
Gen AI Architect Program – Social Eagle Academy  
Batch: 5  
Timeline Goal: March 2026  

---

## 📌 Objective
To demonstrate how structured **JSON prompting** can be used to generate high-quality images using Generative AI models.  
This assignment focuses on **prompt engineering**, not artistic drawing.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

Image generation in GenAI works by converting **text descriptions into visual representations** using large multimodal models.

This project follows an **architect-level approach**:
- Understand the scenario
- Structure it using RTCFR
- Convert it into a JSON prompt
- Generate a realistic image

---

## 🔹 Scenario
A mentor from **Social Eagle Academy** is conducting an online Generative AI class for **Batch-5 students**.  
Learners are engaged, motivated, and excited about becoming **Gen AI Architects by March 2026**.
